    \chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conlusion}
    We have given an introduction to the SCION internet architecture in a form accessible to fellow intresseted professionals. We have layed out the challenges posed by the current and future scale of the global internet and defined a basic set of quality metrics to be fullfiled. We then proceeded in showing that current internet architecture is unable to provide these to a satisfactory level and followed to state our case in support of the necessety for profound change. Following that we explored the concepts of new internet arichtecture proposed by SCION and explained its operation, benefits and security properties. Finally we discussed why and how SCION is able to fullfill our defined quility metrics.
