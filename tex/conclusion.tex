    \section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conlusion}
    I have given an introduction to the SCION internet architecture in a form accessible to fellow interested professionals. I have laid out the challenges posed by the current and future scale of the global internet and defined a basic set of quality metrics to be fulfilled. I then proceeded in showing that current internet architecture is unable to provide these to a satisfactory level, and followed to state my case in support of the necessity for profound change. Subsequently, I explored the concepts of new internet architecture proposed by SCION and explained its operation, benefits, and security properties. Finally, I discussed why and how SCION is able to fulfil my defined quality metrics.
