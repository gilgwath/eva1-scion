    \section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conlusion}
    We have given an introduction to the SCION internet architecture in a form accessible to fellow interested professionals. We have laid out the challenges posed by the current and future scale of the global internet and defined a basic set of quality metrics to be fulfilled. We then proceeded in showing that current internet architecture is unable to provide these to a satisfactory level, and followed to state our case in support of the necessity for profound change. Subsequently, we explored the concepts of new internet architecture proposed by SCION and explained its operation, benefits, and security properties. Finally, we discussed why and how SCION is able to fulfil our defined quality metrics.
