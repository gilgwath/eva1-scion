   This paper is purely based an survey of existing literature. It's main purpose is to digest existing literature into a form easily accessible to other IT professionals unfamiliar with SCION and the details of routing protocols. Most papers concerning SCION are published by Perrig et al. in the course of their groups work on creating the SCION.
   We studied the main papers in which SCION is described as well as some related works discussing testbed deployments of SCION by xY et al. and survey and comparison of next-generation network proposals. We present a condensed and simplfied form of the involved concept as an overview for the uninitiated.
