   This paper is purely based an survey of existing literature. It's main purpose is to digest existing literature into a form easily accessible to other IT professionals unfamiliar with SCION and the details of routing protocols. We studied the main body work published by Perring et al. and surveyed a collection of connected papers. For the detailed description of these see Chapter \ref{ch:related_work}.We present a condensed and simplfied form of the involved concept as an overview for the uninitiated.
