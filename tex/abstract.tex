    The scale of the modern internet and its surrounding threat landscape has outstripped the underlying technologie's capabilities to provide reliable, private and secure communications. To address this issue, a clean slate reengineering of the internet architecture has been proposed by the SCION project. In this paper, I endeavour to give an introduction to this next-generation networking technology by conducting a literature review, by following an iterative drill-down approach and summarizing the result. I digest existing research papers into form easily accessible to fellow IT professionals familiar with the basics of networking but unfamiliar with SCION. This paper outlines a basic set of requirements a modern internet architecture must fulfil to satisfy modern requirements, and I conclude that the current architecture can no longer provide the necessary qualities. Thus, I state my case in support for revolutionary change. I follow by exploring a next-generation internet architecture proposed by the SCION project and conclude by discussing how SCION manages to provide the qualities required to provide reliable, secure and private communication on a modern scale.
