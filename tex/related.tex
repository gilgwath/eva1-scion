    Xin Hhang et al. lay to ground work in specifing SCION in their 2011 paper titled "SCION: Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-Generation Networks
" \cite{scion_2011}. This paper is later updated an referenced in a follow-up paper in 2015 where Barrera et al. revisit revisit SCION \cite{scion_2015}, while in 2017 give a detailed and update overview in the Communiction of the ACM \cite{scion_2017}. Multiple extension to the SCION protocol were proposed as follows. Onion routing was through an extions discribed by Chen et al. \cite{hornet_2015, hornet_2016} and effective defences against DDoS attacks are discussed by Basescu et al. \cite{sibra_2016}, Lee et al. \cite{lee_2017} and Rothenberger et al. \cite{piskes_2020}.
    Since SCION heavily relies on multiple PKI systems Basin et. all propose \cite{arpki_2014} and implement \cite{arpki_2018} an attack resilient PKI model.
