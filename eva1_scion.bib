Our system uses only symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-ﬂow state on intermediate routers. This design enables {HORNET} routers implemented on offthe-shelf hardware to process anonymous trafﬁc at over 93 Gb/s. {HORNET} is also highly scalable, adding minimal processing overhead per additional anonymous channel.},

    abstract = {We make a case for packet-replay suppression at the network layer, a concept that has been generally neglected. Our contribution is twofold. First, we demonstrate a new attack, the router-reﬂection attack, that can be launched using compromised routers. In this attack, a compromised router degrades the connectivity of a remote Internet region just by replaying packets. The attack is feasible even if all packets are attributed to their sources, i.e., source authentication is in place, and our evaluation shows that the threat is pervasive—candidate routers for compromise are in the order of hundreds or thousands.},

    abstract = {Denial-of-service attacks have become increasingly prevalent in the Internet. In many cases they are enabled or facilitated by the lack of source authentication—it is often easy for an attacker to spoof its own {IP} address and thus launch reflection attacks or evade detection. There have been attempts in the past to resolve this issue through filtering or cryptography-based techniques; however, there is still no sufficiently strong system in place today—all proposals either provide weak security guarantees, are not efficient enough, or lack incentives for deployment. In this paper we present {PISKES}, a pragmatic Internet-scale key-establishment system enabling firstpacket authentication. Through the {PISKES} infrastructure, any host can locally obtain a symmetric key to enable a remote service to perform source-address authentication. The remote service can itself locally derive the same key with efficient cryptographic operations. {PISKES} thus enables packet authentication for a wide variety of systems including high-throughput applications like {DNS}. We have implemented a prototype system that enables a {DNS} server to verify the source of every received packet within 85 ns, which is over 220 times faster than a system based on asymmetric cryptography. {PISKES} has been developed for the {SCION} secure Internet architecture but is also applicable to today’s Internet. With its strong source-authentication properties and highly efficient operation it has the potential to finally bring network-layer authentication to the Internet.},

Moreover, {ARPKI} is co-designed with a formal model, and we verify its core security property using the Tamarin prover. We present a proof-of-concept implementation providing all features required for deployment. {ARPKI} eﬃciently handles the certiﬁcation process with low overhead and without incurring additional latency to {TLS}. {ARPKI} oﬀers extremely strong security guarantees, where compromising n − 1 trusted signing and verifying entities is insuﬃcient to launch an impersonation attack. Moreover, it deters misbehavior as all its operations are publicly visible.},

    abstract = {The current Transport Layer Security ({TLS}) Public-Key Infrastructure ({PKI}) is based on a weakest-link security model that depends on over a thousand trust roots. The recent history of malicious and compromised Certiﬁcation Authorities has fueled the desire for alternatives. Creating a new, secure infrastructure is, however, a surprisingly challenging task due to the large number of parties involved and the many ways that they can interact. A principled approach to its design is therefore mandatory, as humans cannot feasibly consider all the cases that can occur due to the multitude of interleavings of actions by legitimate parties and attackers, such as private key compromises (e.g., domain, Certiﬁcation Authority, log server, other trusted entities), key revocations, key updates, etc.},
