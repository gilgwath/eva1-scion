First, we demonstrate a new attack, the router-reﬂection attack, that can be launched using compromised routers. In this attack, a compromised router degrades the connectivity of a remote Internet region just by replaying packets. The attack is feasible even if all packets are attributed to their sources, i.e., source authentication is in place, and our evaluation shows that the threat is pervasive—candidate routers for compromise are in the order of hundreds or thousands.},

    abstract = {Denial-of-service attacks have become increasingly prevalent in the Internet. In many cases they are enabled or facilitated by the lack of source authentication—it is often easy for an attacker to spoof its own {IP} address and thus launch reflection attacks or evade detection. There have been attempts in the past to resolve this issue through filtering or cryptography-based techniques; however, there is still no sufficiently strong system in place today—all proposals either provide weak security guarantees, are not efficient enough, or lack incentives for deployment. In this paper we present {PISKES}, a pragmatic Internet-scale key-establishment system enabling firstpacket authentication. Through the {PISKES} infrastructure, any host can locally obtain a symmetric key to enable a remote service to perform source-address authentication. The remote service can itself locally derive the same key with efficient cryptographic operations. {PISKES} thus enables packet authentication for a wide variety of systems including high-throughput applications like {DNS}. We have implemented a prototype system that enables a {DNS} server to verify the source of every received packet within 85 ns, which is over 220 times faster than a system based on asymmetric cryptography. {PISKES} has been developed for the {SCION} secure Internet architecture but is also applicable to today’s Internet. With its strong source-authentication properties and highly efficient operation it has the potential to finally bring network-layer authentication to the Internet.},

Moreover, {ARPKI} is co-designed with a formal model, and we verify its core security property using the Tamarin prover.

Moreover, it deters misbehavior as all its operations are publicly visible.},

These projects aim to move away from the traditional host-centric networks and replace them with content-centric, mobility-centric, or service-centric networks. However, different principles and designs also raise various issues on network security. For each project, we describe its architecture design and how it deals with security issues. Furthermore, we compare these projects and discuss their pros and cons. Open security issues are pointed out for directing future research.},

Botnetsize independence enables two end hosts to set up communication regardless of the size of distributed botnets in any Autonomous System in the Internet. {SIBRA} thus ends the arms race between {DDoS} attackers and defenders. Furthermore, {SIBRA} is based on purely stateless operations for reservation renewal, ﬂow monitoring, and policing, resulting in highly efﬁcient router operation, which is demonstrated with a full implementation. Finally, {SIBRA} supports Dynamic Interdomain Leased Lines ({DILLs}), offering new business opportunities for {ISPs}.},

    abstract = {Several “{NewSpace}” companies have launched the first of thousands of planned satellites for providing global broadband Internet service. The resulting low-Earth-orbit ({LEO}) constellations will not only bridge the digital divide by providing service to remote areas, but they also promise much lower latency than terrestrial fiber for longdistance routes. We show that unlocking this potential is non-trivial: such constellations provide inherently variable connectivity, which today’s Internet is ill-suited to accommodate. We therefore study cost–performance tradeoffs in the design space for Internet routing that incorporates satellite connectivity, examining four solutions ranging from naïvely using {BGP} to an ideal, clean-slate design. We find that the optimal solution is provided by a path-aware networking architecture in which end-hosts obtain information and control over network paths. However, a pragmatic and more deployable approach inspired by the design of content distribution networks can also achieve stable and close-to-optimal performance.},

	abstract = {With current efforts to design Future Internet Architectures ({FIAs}), the evaluation and comparison of different proposals is an interesting research challenge. Previously, metrics such as bandwidth or latency have commonly been used to compare {FIAs} to {IP} networks. We suggest the use of power consumption as a metric to compare {FIAs}. While low power consumption is an important goal in its own right (as lower energy use translates to smaller environmental impact as well as lower operating costs), power consumption can also serve as a proxy for other metrics such as bandwidth and processor load. Lacking power consumption statistics about either commodity {FIA} routers or widely deployed {FIA} testbeds, we propose models for power consumption of {FIA} routers. Based on our models, we simulate scenarios for measuring power consumption of content delivery in different {FIAs}. Speciﬁcally, we address two questions: 1) which of the proposed {FIA} candidates achieves the lowest energy footprint; and 2) which set of design choices yields a power-efﬁcient network architecture? Although the lack of real-world data makes numerous assumptions necessary for our analysis, we explore the uncertainty of our calculations through sensitivity analysis of input parameters.},

    abstract = {We present the Crossﬁre attack – a powerful attack that degrades and often cuts off network connections to a variety of selected server targets (e.g., servers of an enterprise, a city, a state, or a small country) by ﬂooding only a few network links. In Crossﬁre, a small set of bots directs lowintensity ﬂows to a large number of publicly accessible servers. The concentration of these ﬂows on the small set of carefully chosen links ﬂoods these links and effectively disconnects selected target servers from the Internet. The sources of the Crossﬁre attack are undetectable by any targeted servers, since they no longer receive any messages, and by network routers, since they receive only low-intensity, individual ﬂows that are indistinguishable from legitimate ﬂows. The attack persistence can be extended virtually indeﬁnitely by changing the set of bots, publicly accessible servers, and target links while maintaining the same disconnection targets. We demonstrate the attack feasibility using Internet experiments, show its effects on a variety of chosen targets (e.g., servers of universities, {US} states, East and West Coasts of the {US}), and explore several countermeasures.},
